# Output Component Documentation

This document outlines the structure and functionality of the `Output` component used in a React-based chat application to display messages and manage automatic scrolling.

## Overview

`Output` is a functional React component that utilizes the `useDialog` hook from `DialogContext` to fetch chat message state and ensure that the chat window scrolls to the latest message automatically.

## Component Structure

The component is structured to include:
- **Dialog Component**: This child component (`Dialog`) is responsible for rendering the chat messages.
- **Scroll Mechanism**: Uses a reference (`messagesEndRef`) to manage scrolling behavior.

## Hooks Used

- **useDialog**: Provides access to the chat message state from `DialogContext`.
- **useEffect**: Manages the side effects related to scrolling when the component mounts and updates.

## Internal State and Refs

- **messagesEndRef**: A React ref that points to the end of the message list, used to trigger scrolling.

## Functions

### scrollToBottom
Triggers a smooth scroll to the bottom of the chat messages container. This function is called whenever new messages are added to ensure that the latest message is visible to the user.

## Styling

The component uses CSS modules for styling, specifically defined in `index.module.css`. The styles target the output container and the scrolling mechanism to enhance the usability and visual layout of the chat interface.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { Output } from './path-to-Output';

function ChatInterface() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Output />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Side Effects

- **Initial Mount**: On the initial mount, `scrollToBottom` is called to ensure the view starts at the latest message.
- **On Message Update**: Whenever the `state.messages` array updates (i.e., new messages are added), `scrollToBottom` is scheduled after a slight delay (100 ms) to accommodate for the time it may take for new messages to render.

## Remarks

- It is crucial that `DialogContext` is properly set up and wrapping the component tree where `Output` is used to provide the necessary data for rendering messages.
- The `Output` component is designed for dynamic interaction, making sure the user always sees the most recent messages without manually scrolling.

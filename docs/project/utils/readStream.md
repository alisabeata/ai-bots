# readStream Function Documentation

This documentation provides details on the `readStream` function, which is an asynchronous generator function designed to read and process streamed data from a server response.

## Overview

The `readStream` function is responsible for handling `ReadableStream` of `Uint8Array` obtained from a `Response` object typically returned by the `fetch` API. It decodes the streamed binary data into text, parses it as JSON, and yields the processed text.

## Function Signature

```typescript
async function* readStream(response: Response): AsyncGenerator<string>
```

## Parameters

- `response`: A `Response` object from the fetch API that includes a body property, which is a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`.

## Return Value

- The function is an asynchronous generator that yields strings parsed from the JSON data received in the stream.

## Details

### Operation

#### Stream Reader Initialization
- Initializes a reader (`ReadableStreamDefaultReader`) from the `response.body`.

#### Text Decoding
- Uses `TextDecoder` to decode `Uint8Array` chunks into UTF-8 encoded strings.

#### Chunk Processing
- Each decoded chunk is trimmed and split into sections (assuming sections are separated by double newlines).
- Each section is attempted to be parsed as JSON.

#### Data Yielding
- If JSON parsing is successful, the content of the parsed JSON is yielded.
- If JSON parsing fails, logs the error to the console and yields a placeholder string (' ').

#### Stream Termination
- The loop breaks and stops reading when no more data is available (indicated by `done` being true).

## Usage Example

```javascript
async function handleStream(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
    }

    for await (const content of readStream(response)) {
      console.log(content); // Process each piece of content yielded by the generator
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during streaming:', error);
  }
}
```
